# Classifying space with ML

This repository contains the data and some of the code from machine learning classification experiments that explore how unsupervised node embedding methods may allow new computational access to architectural spatial structures represented as graph structures. The research was conducted as part of my Master's thesis in computational design. A data set specifically created for classification experiments by Ferrando, Dalmasso, Mai and Cardoso Llach [(Ferrando et al., 2019)](http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?cf2019_014) is used.

### Data set
The [original data set](https://github.com/c0deLab/ML-architectural-analytics) contains CAD plans and supporting data of 19 monastery and 20 mosque complexes modeled by the researchers. `data/txt` contains the form of the original data that this project used. However, the linked repository has other forms of the data, including the CAD files and source material for the CAD files. 

### Code



The actual classification experiments were conducted on the Weka tool bench; therefore, the code for those experiments are not included here. The  


Develop grasshopper code to be able to extract more information from the original work. Could be a good opportunity for more sophisticated grasshopper coding and interaction.

Set it up as a template for further work with other encoding algorithms.

Figure out how the GAT repository is working and emulate that.
